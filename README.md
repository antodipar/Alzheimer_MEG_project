The aim of this project was to generate a predictive model that enabled distinguishing a group of healthy
controls from a group of Alzheimer’s disease patients. In particular, patients in a mild cognitive
impairment (MCI) condition.

This project was submitted to the "Data Science Awards Spain 2018", event organized by Synergic Partners, a Telefónica company. Although I did not win the contest, it was an excellent opportunity to further explore new machine learning techniques that I had never tested before.

Many of the ideas applied in this project are based on the scientific publication ["Structural connectivity centrality changes mark the path toward Alzheimer's disease"](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dadm.2018.12.004), being myself a main contributor of this paper.
